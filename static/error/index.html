        <h3>Error: Cannot find Mongo Collection</h3>
        <p>This will need to be corrected in your App Studio by:</p>
        <h4>Upgrade the collection for this tool</h4>
        <p>Click into this app's <em>data browser</em> (for the current environment), then click '<em>upgrade database</em>' to upgrade the collection to dedicated collection and then click '<em>Upgrade now</em>'.</p>
        <p>When doing this the Studio will require a re-deploy of your app, so click the '<em>deploy</em>' button in the prompt that shows up after upgrading.</p>
        <h4>Re-deploy the monitoring tool</h4>
        <p>At this point, some new node modules are required by the monitoring tool, so a '<em>clean deploy</em>' is required to have it install the new requirements. To do this, put a check mark in '<em>clean stage</em>' then click '<em>deploy cloud app</em>'</p>
        <h4>Confirmation</h4>
        <p>Once the deploy is finished, come back to this page and refresh it, and this message should go away.</p>
